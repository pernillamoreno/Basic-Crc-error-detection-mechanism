# Basic-Crc-error-detection-mechanism
This code simulates a basic CRC error detection mechanism, encoding a message, appending a CRC, 
simulating the reception of data, and checking for errors. Note that this is a simple example and 
may not be suitable for all scenarios. More advanced CRC implementations often involve using a 
predefined polynomial and may include additional features for error correction
